# ArUCO-Detection-Distance-ROS
Code Snippets involving OpenCV and Python to detect, label and calculate the distance of ArUCO markers in a Gazebo map using ROS. The code was experimentally verified in a Gazebo simulation where it was used to help localise a bot in a map where known markers wer placed in known locations, and the relative position was used to get a pose estimate
